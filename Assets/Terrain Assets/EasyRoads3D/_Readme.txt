Thank you for purchasing EasyRoads3D Pro!

This package includes v2 and the v3 beta as a separate unityPackage.

V3 is an entirely new road system.

Conform the asset store guidelines both packages will be imported in the folder /Assets/EasyRoads3D/. Be careful if you do not want to mix version specific assets, you may want to import v2 first and rename the folder in for example EasyRoads3D v2.
